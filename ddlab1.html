	<h2> Richard's technology rant </h2> 
  <h3><em>My experience with technology</em> </h3> <p> For my whole life I think technology is great for generally any use. And as of lately, technology has gotten so powerful that it's made it's way to cars, homes, and even toilets! You name it! However, this can also be even life threatening. As everyone knows, technology can even be controlling you!  <br></p> <p> <em> Elon Musk</em>  also known as the owner of the Tesla. Has been working on a human brain chip and it allows you to play music in your head. <br>And it makes you wonder what if it glitches or thereâ€™s a certain defect? I'm pretty sure the results wouldn't be too pleasant.</p> <p> <strong> And that's how Technology can Kill You!</strong>
